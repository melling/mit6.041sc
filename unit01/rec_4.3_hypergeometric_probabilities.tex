\section*{Recitation 4.3: Hypergeometric Probabilities}

3.  Problem  1.61,  page  69  in  the  text.

Hypergeometric  probabilities.  An  urn  contains  n balls,  out  of  which  exactly  m are  red.  We
select  k  of  the  balls  at  random,  without  replacement  (i.e.,  selected  balls  are  not  put  back  into
the  urn  before  the  next  selection).  What  is  the  probability  that  i of  the  selected  balls  are  red?

\begin{itemize}
\item  n balls
\item  m are red
\item  select k at random
\end{itemize

$$\left| \Omega\right| = {n \choose k}$$

$$P_{red}=\dfrac{C}{\left| \Omega \right| }=\dfrac{{m \choose i} {n-m \choose k-i}}{{n \choose k}}$$
